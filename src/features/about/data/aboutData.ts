  "Lipi Epics and Word Games is a learning and gamification platform that brings Indian epics, languages, and cultural values to life through interactive play. Our current focus is the Mahabharat, along with engaging word games in Indian languages and English.",
  "Modern education rarely covers ancient epics and knowledge systems like the Ramayana, Gita, Vedas, Ayurveda, and Chanakya Neeti. At the same time, native-language word games are still far fewer than English ones.",
  "We bridge this gap with AI-powered, high-quality visual and gamified content that makes learning fun, structured, and mobile-first. We also connect digital and physical experiences through apps, games, and a deeper knowledge network for families and communities.",
  "Founded by Sagar Anisingaraju, Lipi is built with a passionate team and supported by seed investors, and we collaborate with partners worldwide to create lasting social impact."
